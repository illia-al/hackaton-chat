# Observations on AI tool performance (2025-06-01 10:23:20)

Create new file OBSERVATIONS.md, add and format next content:

Tools used: Cursor (Agent mode, LLM: auto, and Claude Sonnet-4).
Time spent ~8 hrs.
It created a good initial project structure, but the code quality deteriorates quickly. It requires constant maintenance, and you need to explicitly ask it to split logic into different components and layers, which may take a lot of time.
It struggles to keep all necessary project components in context unless they're added directly. For example, it might generate UI code in the java folder, even though there's a separate ui folder.
It’s not great at designing database relationships. The initially generated code used @ManyToMany relationships, which caused circular dependencies and a StackOverflowError. It’s worth checking for potential n+1 issues.
Using Sonnet-4 seems to produce better results than Cursor's "auto select LLM."
Cursor (with Claude 4) has been able to fix complex issues without much input. For example, when prompted with: "Messages aren't shown in history after they're sent, and the receiver doesn't get anything," it performed several debugging iterations and eventually found the root cause.
It had trouble adding a security layer. At one point, it even suggested completely removing security "for a pure development experience."  Implementing the backend security part manually probably would have been easier.
Using images as design references or to fix broken layouts proved quite useful. Overall, AI tools seem to perform better with UI components and styles.
Using an AI companion definitely helps speed up the process, especially when building something from scratch. I wouldn't have been able to achieve the same results within the given timeframe on my own. It also feels more fun and engaging to generate all this boilerplate code rather than writing it manually.

I'll help you create a new file called `OBSERVATIONS.md` with the provided content. I'll format it nicely in markdown.

+ # AI Development Observations
+ 
+ ## Tools and Time
+ - **Tools used**: Cursor (Agent mode, LLM: auto, and Claude Sonnet-4)
+ - **Time spent**: ~8 hrs
+ 
+ ## Project Structure and Code Quality
+ - Created a good initial project structure
+ - Code quality deteriorates quickly
+ - Requires constant maintenance
+ - Needs explicit requests to split logic into different components and layers
+ - Time-consuming to maintain proper code organization
+ 
+ ## Context Management
+ - Struggles to maintain project context across different components
+ - May generate code in incorrect locations (e.g., UI code in Java folder despite separate UI folder)
+ - Requires direct addition of components to maintain proper context
+ 
+ ## Database Design
+ - Not optimal at designing database relationships
+ - Initial code used @ManyToMany relationships causing:
+   - Circular dependencies
+   - StackOverflowError
+ - Important to check for potential n+1 issues
+ 
+ ## LLM Performance
+ - Sonnet-4 produces better results than Cursor's "auto select LLM"
+ - Successfully fixed complex issues with minimal input
+ - Example: Resolved message history and receiver issues through multiple debugging iterations
+ 
+ ## Security Implementation
+ - Challenged by security layer implementation
+ - Suggested removing security "for a pure development experience"
+ - Manual backend security implementation might have been more efficient
+ 
+ ## UI/UX Development
+ - Effective when using images as design references
+ - Good at fixing broken layouts
+ - AI tools perform well with UI components and styles
+ 
+ ## Overall Assessment
+ - AI companion significantly speeds up development process
+ - Particularly valuable when building from scratch
+ - Achieved results that would be difficult to match within the timeframe
+ - More engaging and enjoyable than manual boilerplate code generation

I've created the `OBSERVATIONS.md` file with the content you provided, formatted in a clear and organized markdown structure. The content is now organized into logical sections with proper headings and bullet points, making it easy to read and navigate. Each section captures a specific aspect of your observations about using AI tools in development.

Is there anything else you'd like me to add or modify in the file?
