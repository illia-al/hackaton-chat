add dockerfile for ui part and add it to the docker compose

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a Dockerfile for the UI part and add it to the docker-compose configuration. First, let me check the package.json to understand the build requirements.


---

Read file: /Users/illiaalieinikov/git/da/hackaton-chat/chat-ui/package.json

---

I'll create a Dockerfile for the React UI application and then update the docker-compose.yml to include it. Let me create the Dockerfile first.


---

```diff
- 
+ # Build stage
+ FROM node:18-alpine as build
+ 
+ WORKDIR /app
+ 
+ # Copy package files
+ COPY package*.json ./
+ 
+ # Install dependencies
+ RUN npm install
+ 
+ # Copy source code
+ COPY . .
+ 
+ # Build the application
+ RUN npm run build
+ 
+ # Production stage
+ FROM nginx:alpine
+ 
+ # Copy built assets from build stage
+ COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
+ 
+ # Copy nginx configuration
+ COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
+ 
+ # Expose port 80
+ EXPOSE 80
+ 
+ # Start nginx
+ CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"] 
```

---

Now I'll create a basic nginx configuration file for serving the React application:


---

```diff
- 
+ server {
+     listen 80;
+     server_name localhost;
+ 
+     location / {
+         root /usr/share/nginx/html;
+         index index.html;
+         try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
+     }
+ 
+     # Enable gzip compression
+     gzip on;
+     gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
+ } 
```

---

Now, I'll update the docker-compose.yml to include the UI service:


---

```diff
      restart: unless-stopped
  
+   ui:
+     build:
+       context: ./chat-ui
+       dockerfile: Dockerfile
+     container_name: chat-ui
+     ports:
+       - "3000:80"
+     depends_on:
+       - app
+     restart: unless-stopped
+ 
    postgres:
      image: postgres:15-alpine
```

---

I've made the following changes:

1. Created a `Dockerfile` for the UI application that:
   - Uses a multi-stage build process to keep the final image size small
   - Uses Node.js 18 Alpine for building the application
   - Uses Nginx Alpine for serving the built application
   - Includes proper configuration for serving a React single-page application

2. Created an `nginx.conf` file that:
   - Configures Nginx to serve the React application
   - Handles client-side routing with `try_files`
   - Enables gzip compression for better performance

3. Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include the UI service that:
   - Builds from the `chat-ui` directory
   - Exposes port 3000 on the host (mapped to port 80 in the container)
   - Depends on the backend service
   - Uses the same restart policy as other services

To use this setup:

1. Make sure you're in the root directory of your project
2. Run `docker-compose up --build` to build and start all services
3. The UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

The UI service will automatically rebuild when you make changes to the React application code. The backend API will be accessible to the UI through the service name `app` on port 8080.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this configuration?

fix

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the error is related to the architecture compatibility issue with the base image. Since you're on an ARM64 machine (Apple Silicon), we need to adjust the Dockerfile to use images that support ARM64 architecture. Let me modify the Dockerfile:


---

```diff
  # Build stage
- FROM node:18-alpine as build
+ FROM --platform=linux/amd64 node:18-alpine as build
  
  WORKDIR /app
```

```diff
  
  # Production stage
- FROM nginx:alpine
+ FROM --platform=linux/amd64 nginx:alpine
  
  # Copy built assets from build stage
```

---

I've updated the Dockerfile to explicitly specify the platform as `linux/amd64` for both build and production stages. This will ensure that Docker uses the correct image architecture that's compatible with your system.

The changes made:
1. Added `--platform=linux/amd64` to the Node.js build stage
2. Added `--platform=linux/amd64` to the Nginx production stage

Now you can try rebuilding the containers with:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This should resolve the architecture compatibility issue. The application will still run properly on your ARM64 machine as Docker will handle the necessary emulation.

error

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the error is now coming from the backend Dockerfile, not the UI one. The issue is with the `eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine` image not being available for ARM64 architecture. Let me fix the backend Dockerfile:


---

```diff
  # Multi-stage build for Spring Boot application
- FROM maven:3.9.4-eclipse-temurin-17 AS build
+ FROM --platform=linux/amd64 maven:3.9.4-eclipse-temurin-17 AS build
  
  # Set working directory
```

```diff
  
  # Runtime stage
- FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine
+ FROM --platform=linux/amd64 eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine
  
  # Install curl for healthcheck
```

---

I've updated the backend Dockerfile to explicitly specify the platform as `linux/amd64` for both build and runtime stages. This will ensure that Docker uses the correct image architecture that's compatible with your system.

The changes made:
1. Added `--platform=linux/amd64` to the Maven build stage
2. Added `--platform=linux/amd64` to the Temurin JRE runtime stage

Now you can try rebuilding all containers with:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This should resolve the architecture compatibility issue for both the backend and frontend services. Docker will handle the necessary emulation to run the AMD64 images on your ARM64 machine.

set REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the Dockerfile to set the environment variable for the React application. We need to set this during the build stage and make it available in the production stage:


---

```diff
  # Copy source code
  COPY . .
+ 
+ # Set environment variable for build
+ ENV REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
  
  # Build the application
```

---

I've added the environment variable `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` in the build stage of the Dockerfile. This will ensure that the React application is built with the correct API URL.

Now you can rebuild the containers with:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The React application will now use `http://localhost:8080` as the base URL for API calls. This will allow the frontend to communicate with the backend service running on port 8080.

how to build only ui

---

_**Assistant**_

To build only the UI service, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose build ui
```

Or if you want to build and start only the UI service:

```bash
docker-compose up --build ui
```

This will only build and run the UI service without affecting the other services (backend, postgres, rabbitmq). The UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000` once it's running.

---

_**User**_

set REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 in docker compose for ui

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the docker-compose.yml to set the environment variable for the UI service:


---

```diff
      ports:
        - "3000:80"
+     environment:
+       - REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
      depends_on:
        - app
```

---

I've added the environment variable to the UI service configuration in docker-compose.yml. Now you can rebuild and start the UI service with:

```bash
docker-compose up --build ui
```

This will ensure that the React application has access to the API base URL during both build and runtime. The environment variable will be available to your React application through `process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`.

+ 
+ # Backend
+ SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/chat_db
+ SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: postgres
+ SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: postgres
+ SPRING_RABBITMQ_HOST: rabbitmq
+ SPRING_RABBITMQ_PORT: 5672
+ SPRING_RABBITMQ_USERNAME: guest
+ SPRING_RABBITMQ_PASSWORD: guest
+ ```
  
```

---

I've updated the README.md file to include:

1. Added Docker and Docker Compose to prerequisites
2. Added a new "Option 1: Docker Compose Setup" section as the recommended way to run the application
3. Reorganized the manual setup as "Option 2"
4. Added a new section with Docker environment variables
5. Improved the structure with better heading hierarchy
6. Added information about RabbitMQ Management UI access

The README now provides clear instructions for both Docker-based and manual setup, making it easier for users to get started with the application.
